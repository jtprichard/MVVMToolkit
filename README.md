# MVVMToolkit
A very basic toolkit for WPF primarily using MVVM pattern.

### BASE REFERENCE CLASSES
  The BaseViewModel and RelayCommand classes may be referenced for WPF commands and IPropertyChanged

### STYLES
  My own styles for basic controls.  There is nothing overly complicated here, but may be useful to develop your own custom styles.  
  The styles are referenced by the RevitWPFFW project here: https://github.com/jtprichard/RevitWPFFW

### DIALOGSERVICES
  Classes that support a dialog service pattern to allow views to be called from the viewmodel.
  Note that there are no location services currently incorporated into this. 

### DIALOGS
  Includes a series of dialogs that I've created for learning purposes.  
  These will likely eventually be extended to reference standard .net dialog boxes for consistency.
  I have incoporated a custom generic list dialog box for adding, changing, and removing items.

### EXAMPLES
  I will soon have sample code that will illustrate how these work.  
  For the time being, dialog services and styles are used in teh RevitWPFFW project.  https://github.com/jtprichard/RevitWPFFW
